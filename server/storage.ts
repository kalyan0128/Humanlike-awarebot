        content: `# Juice Jacking Attack

## Scenario Description
This attack exploits public USB charging stations in airports, hotels, and conference centers. Modified charging ports or cables are used to establish data connections with connected devices, allowing attackers to extract data or install malware while the device charges.

## Risk Factors
- People often need to charge devices while traveling
- USB connections allow both power and data transfer
- Low battery anxiety can override security concerns
- Public charging stations are increasingly common

## Real-World Impact
At several international airports, investigators discovered compromised charging stations that were copying photos, contact lists, and account information from connected devices. Some advanced stations installed monitoring software that continued to extract data long after the device was disconnected.

## Defense Strategies
1. Use AC wall outlets rather than USB ports when possible
2. Carry portable battery packs for emergency charging
3. Use "USB condoms" or data-blocking adapters that prevent data transfer
4. Power off devices completely before connecting to unknown charging ports
5. Consider carrying your own charging cables and adapters`,

        content: `# Tech Support Scam

## Scenario Description
Victims receive unsolicited calls, pop-up messages, or emails claiming to be from tech support services (often impersonating Microsoft, Apple, or other known companies). They claim to have detected viruses or problems with the victim's computer and offer to fix them remotely - either installing malware during "repair" or charging for unnecessary services.

## Risk Factors
- Technical problems are common and frustrating
- Most users lack advanced technical knowledge
- Legitimate remote support services exist
- Brand impersonation lends credibility

## Real-World Impact
An elderly user received a convincing "warning" pop-up while browsing, claiming their Microsoft Windows was infected. The provided support number connected them to scammers who gained remote access to their computer, "demonstrated" fake problems, and charged $499 for unnecessary "lifetime protection services" while installing monitoring software.

## Defense Strategies
1. Remember that legitimate tech companies don't send unsolicited messages or make unsolicited calls
2. Never give remote access to someone who contacts you unexpectedly
3. Ignore pop-up messages with support numbers
4. Contact tech support directly through official websites or product documentation
5. Be suspicious of support requiring payment via gift cards or wire transfers`,

- Multiple legitimate communications are expected during booking processes
- Travel arrangements are time-sensitive
- Hotel confirmations commonly require credit card information

## Real-World Impact
Several executives traveling to an industry conference received emails claiming their hotel reservations needed to be confirmed due to a system update. The email directed them to a convincing but fraudulent site that collected their credit card details and personal information.

## Defense Strategies
1. Verify changes to travel arrangements by calling hotels directly using numbers from official websites
2. Be suspicious of unexpected booking changes, especially those requiring immediate action
3. Book travel through established corporate travel programs or reputable agencies
4. Check URLs carefully before entering payment information
5. Use credit cards with strong fraud protection for travel expenses`,

## Scenario Description
Victims receive emails or text messages that appear to be from legitimate delivery services (UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc.) claiming there's a problem with a delivery. The message contains a link to "update delivery preferences" or "track a package" that leads to a credential-harvesting site or prompts malware downloads.

## Risk Factors
- Online shopping has become extremely common
- People regularly receive legitimate shipping notifications
- Delivery problems do occur and require customer action
- The convenience of clicking tracking links is habit-forming

## Real-World Impact
During the holiday shopping season, a campaign of fake DHL delivery notification emails reached millions of consumers. The emails claimed packages couldn't be delivered due to "address problems" and directed recipients to a convincing but fraudulent site that harvested login credentials for multiple platforms.

## Defense Strategies
1. Access delivery services directly through official apps or websites
2. Check sender email addresses carefully for slight misspellings
3. Be suspicious if you're not expecting a delivery
4. Track shipments using order numbers from your purchase confirmations

## Scenario Description
Professionals receive personalized emails or LinkedIn messages from supposed recruiters inviting them to interview for attractive positions. The process seems legitimate until candidates are asked to provide sensitive personal information, pay for "background checks," or install specialized "interview software" that contains malware.

## Risk Factors
- Career advancement is a powerful motivator
- Legitimate recruiters do make unsolicited contact
- Job application processes require personal information
- Video interviews and specialized platforms are common

## Real-World Impact
A technology professional received a convincing interview request for a high-paying remote position. After initial phone interviews, they were asked to install "proprietary interview software" for a technical assessment. The software was actually a remote access trojan that gave attackers access to their current employer's systems.

## Defense Strategies
1. Research companies and recruiters thoroughly before engaging
2. Be suspicious of unusually attractive offers or expedited hiring processes
3. Never pay money upfront for any part of a legitimate job application
4. Verify job opportunities through company career pages
5. Use caution when installing unknown software for interview processes`,

## Scenario Description
An attacker creates a fictional scenario (pretext) and assumes a role relevant to that scenario to manipulate victims into providing information or access. For example, they might pose as a new employee needing help, an IT auditor conducting a security assessment, or a researcher collecting industry data.

## Risk Factors
- Employees want to be helpful to colleagues and partners
- Organizational knowledge may be distributed across teams
- Busy professionals may not take time to verify identities
- Impersonating insiders or authority figures is effective

## Real-World Impact
A social engineer posing as an external auditor contacted various departments within a company, gathering bits of seemingly innocent information. By combining these pieces from different sources, they assembled enough knowledge to successfully impersonate an executive and authorize a fraudulent wire transfer.

## Defense Strategies
1. Verify the identity of unknown individuals before providing information
2. Have clear policies about what information can be shared and with whom
3. Establish verification procedures for common scenarios (new employees, audits, etc.)
4. Create a culture where verification is respected, not seen as unhelpful

## Scenario Description
In this cutting-edge attack, criminals use artificial intelligence to create convincing deepfake videos of executives or trusted figures during live video conferences. These sophisticated impersonations can be used to direct employees to transfer funds, share sensitive information, or provide system access.

## Risk Factors
- Video verification has traditionally been considered highly reliable
- Remote work has normalized video conference communications
- AI technology for real-time deepfakes is rapidly advancing
- Executives may have extensive video footage available for training AI models

## Real-World Impact
In a 2022 case, financial employees joined a video call they believed was with their CFO (based on an invitation from his apparently compromised email). The "CFO" on video directed an urgent wire transfer for a confidential acquisition. The deepfake was convincing enough that $35 million was transferred before the fraud was discovered.

## Defense Strategies
1. Implement multi-factor, multi-channel verification for significant requests
2. Establish pre-arranged verification questions or signals with key executives
3. Be suspicious of unexpected video calls, especially those with unusual requests
4. Develop and enforce financial approval processes that cannot be circumvented

## Scenario Description
Rather than directly targeting victims, attackers identify and compromise websites regularly visited by their intended targets (industry-specific resources, local news, professional associations). When victims visit these legitimate but compromised sites, they are served malware specifically designed for the target organization.

## Risk Factors
- Trusted websites receive less scrutiny from users
- Industry-specific sites may have weaker security but highly valuable visitors
- Targeted malware can be designed to evade specific security measures
- Legitimate business research requires visiting various websites

## Real-World Impact
A nation-state threat actor compromised multiple websites serving a specific industrial sector. When employees from targeted companies visited these industry resources, they unknowingly downloaded malware that specifically targeted industrial control systems, resulting in operational disruptions.

## Defense Strategies
1. Implement robust endpoint protection and browser isolation technologies
2. Keep all systems and applications fully patched and updated
3. Use network monitoring to detect unusual connections or data transfers
4. Employ strict web filtering and reputation services

## Scenario Description
Fun social media quizzes (Which character are you? What's your career destiny? What does your name mean?) appear harmless but are designed to collect personal information that can be used for password cracking, security question answers, or targeted phishing attacks.

## Risk Factors
- Quizzes are entertaining and highly shareable
- Questions often align with common security questions
- Social pressure encourages participation
- Privacy implications aren't obvious to participants

## Real-World Impact
A popular "Your Career History" quiz asked users to combine their first pet's name, the street they grew up on, and their first job—effectively collecting answers to common account recovery questions. This data was later used in targeted account takeover attempts.

## Defense Strategies
1. Be suspicious of quizzes asking for personal information
2. Never share information that resembles password reset or security questions
3. Review privacy settings on social media platforms regularly

## Scenario Description
As QR code payments become more common in restaurants and retail environments, attackers place their own fraudulent QR codes over legitimate ones. When customers scan these codes to pay, they are directed to convincing but fake payment sites that steal credit card information or initiate payments to attacker-controlled accounts.

## Risk Factors
- QR code contents cannot be determined visually
- Payment QR codes in public places are accessible to tampering
- Customers expect to be directed to payment sites after scanning
- Small visual differences in QR codes won't be noticeable

## Real-World Impact
A restaurant chain discovered that attackers had placed overlay stickers with modified QR codes on their table payment instructions. Hundreds of customers had scanned these codes and submitted payment details to fraudulent sites before the compromise was detected.

## Defense Strategies
1. Verify that QR codes haven't been tampered with (check for stickers or overlays)
2. Examine the URL carefully before entering payment information
3. Use only official payment apps rather than scanning to web-based payment forms
4. Check that payment pages use HTTPS and match the expected business domain

        content: `# Mobile Device Management Policy

## Purpose
This policy defines the requirements for mobile devices to connect to organizational networks and data to ensure appropriate security controls are in place.

## Scope
This policy applies to all company-owned and personally-owned mobile devices that access, store, or process organizational data, including but not limited to smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

## Enrollment Requirements
- All devices accessing organizational data must be enrolled in the Mobile Device Management (MDM) system
- Users must accept the terms and conditions of MDM enrollment
- Devices must meet minimum security requirements before enrollment approval
- Devices that cannot meet security requirements will be denied access

## Security Controls
The following security controls will be enforced through MDM:
- Device passcode/PIN/biometric requirements
- Automatic screen locking after inactivity
- Device encryption
- Remote wipe capability
- Automatic security updates
- Application blacklisting/whitelisting
- Jailbreak/root detection
- Data loss prevention controls
- Network security requirements

## Application Management
- The organization may deploy required applications to enrolled devices
- Certain high-risk applications may be blocked on enrolled devices
- A corporate application catalog will be available for self-service installation
- Application permissions may be restricted to protect organizational data

## Data Management
- Corporate data will be isolated from personal data where possible
- Automatic backups of corporate data will be configured
- Data sharing between applications may be restricted
- Screenshots of sensitive applications may be disabled
- Printing from mobile devices may be controlled

## Privacy Considerations
- The organization will only collect data relevant to security and compliance
- Personal data and communications will not be monitored
- Location tracking will only be enabled for specific business needs or in case of theft
- Users will be informed of what data is collected and how it is used

## Lost or Stolen Devices
- Lost or stolen devices must be reported immediately
- Remote location may be activated to find lost devices
- Remote wipe will be initiated for devices that cannot be recovered
- Law enforcement reports may be required for stolen devices

## Policy Enforcement
- Non-compliant devices will be blocked from accessing organizational resources
- Users who repeatedly violate this policy may lose mobile access privileges
- Attempts to circumvent MDM controls are prohibited

## Separation Procedures
- Upon employment termination, corporate data will be removed from devices
- Company-owned devices must be returned in working condition
- Personal devices will undergo selective wipe of corporate data`,
